For the sixth consecutive year, Anaconda conducted our State of Data Science survey to surface insights about the demographics of the data science community, use cases across industries, and trends related to artificial intelligence (AI). This year’s survey revealed insights about the topic on everyone’s minds: generative AI and how it is changing the way data scientists work. The survey also addressed the use of open-source software (OSS), security methods and challenges, and how organizations are dealing with rapid innovation and upskilling. Our report highlights key insights related to these areas and what they could mean for the future of data science in a world increasingly driven by the predictive capabilities of machine learning.
